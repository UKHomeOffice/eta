We will reply within 5 working days (Monday-Friday). We will ask for more information if we need it.

#If you are waiting for a decision

You need to apply for an ETA before you travel to the UK. If you need to, you can travel to the UK while waiting for a decision. You will need to go through border control when you arrive.
